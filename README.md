Breast Cancer Detection Web App using Streamlit

This is a web app for detecting breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. The app takes a user's input data and returns a prediction of whether or not the patient has breast cancer.
The machine learning model used in this web app is based on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. The dataset contains 569 samples of breast mass, and each sample has 30 features. 

The breast cancer detection model was trained using the following machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
Out of these algorithms, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm gave the best accuracy on the dataset. So, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used in the final model that is being used in the web app due to its accuracy and efficiency in classification tasks.

Streamlit is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on making it easy to create beautiful, data-rich web apps. It comes with a wide range of built-in widgets and data visualizations, including sliders, dropdowns, charts, and more. Streamlit also supports integration with popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, making it easy to incorporate machine learning models and data analysis into your web apps.

One of the key benefits of using Streamlit is that it enables you to rapidly prototype and iterate on your web app. You can quickly test different ideas, adjust parameters, and explore different data visualizations to see what works best. Streamlit also makes it easy to share your app with others by providing a simple web address that can be shared with anyone.
